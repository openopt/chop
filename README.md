:warning: This library is in early development, API might change without notice. The examples will be kept up to date. :warning:

## Stochastic Algorithms

We define stochastic optimizers in the `chop.stochastic` module. These follow PyTorch Optimizer conventions, similar to the `torch.optim` module.
These can be used to 
- train structured models;
- compute universal adversarial perturbations over a dataset.

## Full Gradient Algorithms

We also define full-gradient algorithms which operate on a batch of optimization problems in the `chop.optim` module. These are used for adversarial attacks, using the `chop.Adversary` wrapper.

## Installing

Run the following:

```
pip install chop-pytorch
```
or
```
pip install git+https://github.com/openopt/chop.git
```
for the latest development version.

Welcome to `chop`!
