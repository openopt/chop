"""
Penalties.
=========
This module contains classes representing penalties / regularizers.
They function batch-wise, similar to objects in `chop.constraints`.
Reshaping will be of order if the penalties are used on the parameters of a model.

Code inspired from https://github.com/openopt/copt/.

The proximal operators are derived e.g. in https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/opt_book.pdf.

          groups: iterable of iterables
            Each element of groups will be used to index the given tensor to compute
            the penalty on. See example.

        Examples:
          Our input is of shape (batch_size, 4), and we want to split the features in two groups.
          The first contains the first two features, and the second the latter two. This is done by:
            $ groups = [(0, 1), (2, 3)]

          In this case, since the groups are of equal size, we could have used
            $ groups = torch.tensor([[0, 1],
            $                        [2, 3]])

          If the input is of shape (batch_size, 4, 2), and we want to split
          our features in 2 groups (left half and right half of the image), then each group
          is an iterable over the coordinates contained in it.

            $ groups = [((0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)),
            $           ((2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1))]

          The same convention is used for higher dimension inputs.
          If the provided coordinates are of smaller dimension, they will be prepended
          by an Ellipsis.

        Todo:
          * Test the Ellipsis behavior.
